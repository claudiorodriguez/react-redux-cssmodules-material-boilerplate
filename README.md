# react-redux-cssmodules-material-example
A working example of a stub app based on React, Redux, CSS Modules, Material UI, and Webpack. Testing with Mocha and Enzyme.

## What it is
This is intended to be a boilerplate, a working stub project that comes with all the following working together out of the box:

 * [react]
 * [redux]
 * [material-ui]
 * [webpack]
 * [react-hot-loader]
 * [react-css-modules]
 * [gulp] with [eslint] and [sass-lint]
 * [mocha] and [enzyme] for testing

## Installation

 * `git clone` the project
 * `npm install` to install dependencies
 * `npm run watch` to start dev environment, hot loader mode, default `localhost:8090`
 * `npm run build` to build for production environment, output is on `dist`
 * `npm run start` to start stub server serving production assets, go to `localhost:8090/public`
 * `npm run validate` to validate js/scss (useful for git hooks)
 * `npm run test` to run tests
